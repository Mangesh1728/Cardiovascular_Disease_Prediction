# Ten-Year CHD Risk Prediction

This project is a Streamlit web application for predicting the Ten-Year Coronary Heart Disease (CHD) Risk based on patient information. It utilizes a trained machine learning model, specifically a Logistic Regression model, to make predictions.

## Features

- Allows users to input their demographic and health-related information.
- Predicts the Ten-Year CHD Risk based on the provided data.
- Displays the predicted risk as either "High Risk" or "Low Risk" to the user.

## How to Use

1. Install the required dependencies listed in the `requirements.txt` file:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

2. Run the Streamlit app:

```
streamlit run app.py
```

3. Access the web application in your browser using the provided URL.

## Files

- `app.py`: The main Streamlit application file.
- `logistic_regression_model.pkl`: The trained Logistic Regression model file.
- `requirements.txt`: List of Python dependencies required to run the application.

## Technologies Used

- Python
- Streamlit
